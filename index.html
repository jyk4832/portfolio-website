            <p>Born in 2005 in Seoul, South Korea.
                I want to learn, to read, to help, to explore, to experience, 
                to work, to seize every opportunity â€” there's so much to do 
                in this one lifetime. Whether it's diving into new subjects, 
                connecting with others, or embarking on adventures, I believe 
                that each experience shapes who we are.

            <h2>Credit & CopyCats</h2>
            <p>This is my second portfolio website I created.</p>
            <!-- <p>The concept of the website is inpired by Keita Yamada</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Now, you might think that I simply 'copied his work and claim to be self-done'. But
                I want to be clear that none of the codes were copied. In fact, none of the codes 
                were given. I was simply given the looks of the website, just like everyone else. </p> -->
            <p>I thought it would be a good practice to make a creative portfolio website.
                This portfolio is still a work in 
                progress and will continue to change as I develop my skills. Hope you return one 
                day to see what it has become.</p>
            <!-- <p>Unfortunately, the code for this website is publicily available on GitHub as I 
                use its domain to present you this website. </p> -->
